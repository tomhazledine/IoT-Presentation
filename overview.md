IoT

## Data vs information & Insight

* 2Â°C, 565 GtCO<sub>2</sub>, & 2,795 GtCO<sub>2</sub>
* 2009 Copenhagen Climate Accord
* Saudi Arabia increasing oil production despite price drops

## Data in the Build/Measure/Learn loop

## What is IoT? How does IoT work? Why now?

* consumer (household) IoT vs. business/enterprise IoT
* smart objects: measure and automate
* predictive, real-time analytics leading to action
* golden age for IoT:
    - cheap connectivity
    - cheap computing power
    - cheap big-data processing

## Examples

* Aviation Data Capture
* GE Jet Engine Dust Wash
* "Smart" F-35
* Trains: 1mph = $200k
* Wind Turbine Turbulence

## Call to Action

* 70% of energy consumption is (or can be) electricity.
* Smart energy markets naturally favour renewables.
* The Internet of Toys will set the standards and protocols.
* It's much easier to innovate with products that don't kill people.
